# Michael wants me to check out fly

if you have some free time tomorrow I’d LOVE to walk you through this and get some feedback!

- https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/docker/
- https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/deno/#add-fly-manifest

for the docker link:

1. Any old docker image? Any requirements or expectations?
2. Any old repository? Your repository?
3. What’s apps:create “doing”
4. -
5. a. URL should link

the formatting for 5b didn’t work out super well - I think that should be a couple lines?

It looks like 5 mostly describes how to do 2 within fly registry? Or do I create a docker image, push somewhere, create fly app, push fly app There’s some odd flow to those docs

at a glance the deno link makes more sense - I’m going to give that one a go

* Deno imports shouldn't have .ts in path
